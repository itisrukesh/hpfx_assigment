# hpfx_assigment
A standalone python application that integrates with Gmail API and performs some rule based operations on emails.

# Gmail-API Rule Engine -- Mail Processing

The project scripts connects to the Gmail API, fetches emails, and applies user-defined rules to automate actions like labeling and marking as read. 
It logs the entire process and maintains full traceability of rule applications in a local database.

Built with **Python**, the project is designed using **SOLID principles**, tested with **unit + integration tests** in test/ folder, and includes logging, environment configs, and a modular structure for long-term maintainability.

## Features (Based on Assignment)

- Connects securely to Gmail API via OAuth2
- Fetches and stores email metadata in a local SQLite DB
- Loads rules from `rules.json` to match emails by fields (e.g., sender, subject)
- Supports match predicates: `Contains`, `Does Not Contain`, `Equals`.
- Processes rule actions: `mark_as_read`, `move_to_label:<label_name>` [Supports both predefined & customized GMAIL LABELS]
- Stores rule application history. (for rollbacks, traces of matched emails, rules)
- Modular code structure using Single Responsibility principle
- `.env`-driven config and `.logs/` for traceable logging
- Fully tested with `unittest` and `coverage`

### 2. ⚙️ Setup Instructions
📄 Create a .env File   
```bash
CREDSFILE="credentials.json" (your-credentials.json-filepath)
TOKENFILE="token.json" (your-token.json-filepath)
DEBUG="False"
PORTVAL=8080

DBFILEVAL="usermails.db"
EMAILSTABLEVAL="emails"
HISTORYTABLEVAL='processing_history'
```

### 3. 🧠 Sample Rule File (rules.json)
```bash
[
  {
    "rule_id": "Rid001",
    "name": "Ignore Promotions",
    "predicate": "All",
    "conditions": [
      {"field": "sender", "predicate": "Contains", "value": "noreply@"}
    ],
    "actions": ["mark_as_read", "move_to_label:PROMOTIONS"]
  }
]
```

### 4. 🔐 Set Up Gmail OAuth credentials.json
📌 This file is not included. You must generate your own.
Follow these steps:
Visit Google Cloud Console: [text](https://developers.google.com/workspace/gmail/api/guides)

-- Create or select a project

-- Enable Gmail API

-- Go to APIs & Services → Credentials

-- Click Create Credentials → OAuth Client ID

-- Choose Desktop App, give it a name

-- Download the file and rename it to credentials.json

Place it in your project root (next to main.py)

## 5. 📧 Run Script - Process Emails!
Once Completion of All setup now you can Run Scripts. In terminal: Use following command!
```bash
python main.py
```
